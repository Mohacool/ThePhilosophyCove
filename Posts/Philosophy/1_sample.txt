Wonders of the Eye (Sample)

February 8 2020

In considering vision as achieved by the means of an image formed at the bottom of the eye, we must wonder at the smallness yet correctness of the picture, the subtlety of
the touch, the fineness of the lines. A landscape of five or six square leagues is brought into a space of half an inch diameter; yet the multitude of objects that it contains are all preserved, all distinguished in their sizes, positions, shapes,
colours. The prospect from Hampstead hill is compressed into the area of a sixpence, yet represented in detail.

 A stage coach travelling at its ordinary speed for half an hour passes, in the eye, over only one-twelfth of an inch; yet this change of place in the image is distinctly perceived throughout its whole progress, for it is only by means of that perception that the motion of the coach itself is made sensible to the eye. If anything can lessen our admiration of the smallness
of the visual tablet compared with the extent of vision, it is the reflection—to which we are constantly led by the view
of nature—that in the hands of the Creator the difference
between great and little is nothing.

Sturmius held that the examination of the eye was a cure for atheism. Everything belonging to it and about it shows an
extraordinary degree of care, an anxiety for its preservation, because of its value and its tenderness. It is lodged in
a strong, deep, bony socket, composed by the junction of
seven different bones, hollowed out at their edges. Within this socket it is embedded in fat, of all animal substances
the best adapted both to its repose and its motion. It is sheltered by the eyebrows; an arch of hair which like a
thatched penthouse prevents the sweat and moisture of the forehead from running down into it
